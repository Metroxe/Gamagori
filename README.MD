## Inspiration

For our game _REST_, we tried to interpret the idea of "resolution" in two ways: firstly in the graphical sense, as the game transitions in its levels from 1-bit graphics (a la the old Atari games) to 8-bit graphics (the NES), and then lastly into a fully hand-drawn environment. Secondly, the idea of resolution is expressed in the game's narrative, reflected by the protagonist's dreams as he attempts to find self-actualization in his quest to leave the dream.

Our inspirations were of course NES games and the retro games of old, such as The Legend of Zelda and Lemmings. From a gameplay standpoint, we drew inspiration from the old NES game Adventures of Lolo. In the second dream we feature Pac Man ghosts as enemies.

## Development

We decided to use PhaserJS Community Edition to build our game, as our development team comes from an extensive Javascript background and we shared a strong desire to hone our Typescript (OOP Javascript) skills.

## Design

We decided to use an 1-bit style featuring simple colors and squares for the first dream. For the second dream we decided to go with an 8-bit style. We used Adobe Photoshop and basic colour palette. For the video introduction we used vector illustrations created on Adobe Illustrator and we put them together in Adobe After Effects. All of our illustrations, even the ones inspired on retro games  were created by ourselves.
